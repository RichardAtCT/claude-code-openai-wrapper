# Expert Requirements Questions

## Q6: Should Jarvis maintain separate conversation sessions for different users or contexts (e.g., work vs personal)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (better privacy and context separation, aligns with Claude's session management)

## Q7: When Claude tools are enabled, should Jarvis ask for user confirmation before executing potentially destructive operations (Write, Edit, Bash)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (safety first - prevent accidental file modifications or system changes)

## Q8: Should vision analysis results be cached to avoid re-processing the same images?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (saves API costs and improves response time for repeated queries)

## Q9: Should the performance optimization include batching multiple tool operations into single Claude API calls?
**Default if unknown:** No (could make debugging harder and reduce real-time feedback)

## Q10: Should Jarvis automatically switch between Claude models based on task complexity (e.g., use cheaper models for simple queries)?
**Default if unknown:** No (consistency is important, and model switching could confuse users)
