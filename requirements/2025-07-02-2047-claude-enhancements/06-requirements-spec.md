# Claude Enhancement Requirements Specification

## Problem Statement
Now that Claude has been successfully integrated into Jarvis as the primary reasoning engine, there are significant opportunities to enhance Jarvis's capabilities by leveraging Claude's advanced features including tool use, session memory, vision analysis, and performance optimizations.

## Solution Overview
Enhance Jarvis to fully utilize Claude's capabilities while maintaining the existing tool ecosystem and user experience. This includes enabling Claude's native tools for file operations, implementing conversation memory, integrating vision analysis through existing infrastructure, and optimizing performance.

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Enhanced Reasoning Capabilities
- **FR1.1:** Implement multi-turn reasoning for complex decisions
- **FR1.2:** Add support for Claude's chain-of-thought reasoning
- **FR1.3:** Enable Claude to provide detailed explanations for tool selection
- **FR1.4:** Implement confidence scoring for decisions

### FR2: Claude Tools Integration
- **FR2.1:** Enable Claude's native tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, etc.) in Jarvis
- **FR2.2:** Implement user confirmation dialogs for destructive operations (Write, Edit, Bash)
- **FR2.3:** Create hybrid operations where Jarvis tools and Claude tools work together
- **FR2.4:** Add tool operation logging for audit trails

### FR3: Conversation Memory
- **FR3.1:** Implement session continuity using Claude's session management
- **FR3.2:** Maintain a single conversation context (no user/context separation)
- **FR3.3:** Persist session IDs across Jarvis restarts
- **FR3.4:** Implement session expiry handling and renewal

### FR4: Vision Integration
- **FR4.1:** Integrate Claude's vision capabilities with existing Jarvis vision tool
- **FR4.2:** Support image analysis through existing vision infrastructure
- **FR4.3:** Handle multiple image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- **FR4.4:** Provide detailed scene descriptions and object detection

### FR5: Performance Optimization
- **FR5.1:** Implement response caching for repeated queries
- **FR5.2:** Enable streaming responses for real-time feedback
- **FR5.3:** Optimize API calls to reduce latency
- **FR5.4:** Integrate with existing performance cache system

## Technical Requirements

### TR1: API Integration Changes
- **TR1.1:** Modify `WorkflowPlannerAgent.use_claude_reasoning()` to include `enable_tools: true`
- **TR1.2:** Add session_id parameter to all Claude API calls
- **TR1.3:** Implement proper error handling for tool operations
- **TR1.4:** Handle rate limiting gracefully

### TR2: File Modifications
- **TR2.1:** Update `jarvis_pure_adaptive_claude_launcher.py`:
  - Add `enable_tools` parameter to Claude requests
  - Implement confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
  - Add session management logic
- **TR2.2:** No changes needed to Claude wrapper (already supports all features)
- **TR2.3:** Enhance existing vision tool to pass images to Claude

### TR3: Data Persistence
- **TR3.1:** Store Claude session IDs in local configuration
- **TR3.2:** Implement session recovery on startup
- **TR3.3:** Add conversation history export/import

### TR4: Safety & Security
- **TR4.1:** Implement confirmation prompts for:
  - File writes and edits
  - Bash command execution
  - Any operation that modifies system state
- **TR4.2:** Log all tool operations with timestamps
- **TR4.3:** Implement operation rollback where possible

## Implementation Hints

### Session Management Pattern
```python
# In jarvis_pure_adaptive_claude_launcher.py
class WorkflowPlannerAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.claude_session_id = self._load_or_create_session()
    
    def use_claude_reasoning(self, context, options):
        payload = {
            "model": self.reasoning_model,
            "messages": [...],
            "session_id": self.claude_session_id,
            "enable_tools": True,  # Enable Claude tools
            "temperature": 0.3,
            "stream": True  # Enable streaming
        }
```

### Confirmation Dialog Pattern
```python
def confirm_destructive_operation(operation_type, details):
    """Ask user confirmation for destructive operations"""
    if operation_type in ['write', 'edit', 'bash']:
        response = input(f"⚠️ Claude wants to {operation_type}: {details}\nProceed? (y/N): ")
        return response.lower() == 'y'
    return True
```

### Vision Integration Pattern
```python
# Integrate with existing vision tool
if tool_name == "vision" and "claude_analyze" in operation:
    # Pass image to Claude through existing vision infrastructure
    # Use base64 encoding for image data
    image_data = existing_vision_tool.capture()
    claude_response = analyze_with_claude(image_data)
```
