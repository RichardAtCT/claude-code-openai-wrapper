# Expert Detail Questions

Now that I understand the codebase and requirements, here are specific implementation questions:

## Q6: Should the Docker container automatically handle Claude browser authentication on startup?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (users expect seamless authentication flow without manual intervention)

## Q7: Should we use a lightweight desktop environment (XFCE) instead of full Ubuntu desktop for better performance?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (XFCE is more resource-efficient for Docker containers while still supporting browsers)

## Q8: Should the container expose VNC on the standard port 5900 for GUI access?
**Default if unknown:** No (use web-based noVNC on port 6080 for easier browser access without VNC client)

## Q9: Should authentication credentials persist between container restarts using mounted volumes?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (avoid re-authentication on every container restart)

## Q10: Should we create an Unraid Community App template for easy one-click installation?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (standard practice for Unraid applications to maximize user adoption)
