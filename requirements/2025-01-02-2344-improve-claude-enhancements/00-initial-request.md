# Initial Request

**Date:** 2025-01-02 23:44
**Request:** Improve vision capabilities and face recognition

## Context
The user wants to improve the vision capabilities in the Jarvis system, specifically focusing on:

1. **Vision tool response quality** - Current responses like "I can see 2 people, with 61% confidence" need to be more natural and informative
2. **Face recognition integration** - System should remember and identify family members
3. **Claude enhancement for vision** - Better integration between vision tool and Claude's analysis capabilities

## Current Issues
- Vision responses are too technical/robotic
- No face recognition for identifying known people
- Family members are not remembered between sessions
- Low confidence detections create unclear responses

## Specific Requirements from User
- "vision we need to improve vision"
- "we also need to add vision recognition as it needs to remember the family members at my house"
- Current output shows technical details (61% confidence, 4 low-confidence detections filtered)

## Potential Areas for Enhancement
- Integrate face recognition with family member database
- Improve natural language responses for vision
- Add persistent storage for recognized faces
- Enhance Claude's vision analysis capabilities
- Create more conversational and helpful vision feedback
