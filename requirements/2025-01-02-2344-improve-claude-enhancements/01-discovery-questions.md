# Discovery Questions

These questions will help understand the scope and context for improving vision capabilities and face recognition.

## Q1: Should the face recognition system automatically learn and remember new family members when introduced?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (convenience feature - users can introduce family members once and system remembers them)

## Q2: Will the vision system need to work with multiple camera sources (webcam, security cameras, etc.)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (Jarvis already has UniFi Protect integration, should leverage multiple sources)

## Q3: Should recognized family members trigger personalized responses or actions?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (personalization improves user experience - e.g., "Good morning, John" vs generic greeting)

## Q4: Will the face recognition data need to be kept private and stored locally only?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (privacy is critical for home/family data - no cloud storage of faces)

## Q5: Should the vision system provide real-time alerts when detecting unknown people?
**Default if unknown:** No (focus on family recognition first, security features can be added later)
