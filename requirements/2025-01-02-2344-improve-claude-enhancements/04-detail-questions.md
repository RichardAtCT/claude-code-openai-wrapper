# Detail Questions

These expert-level questions address specific implementation details based on the codebase analysis.

## Q6: Should the system automatically switch between vision and face_recognition tools, or merge them into a unified vision experience?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (merge them - users shouldn't need to think about which tool to use, just ask "who is that?" and get an answer)

## Q7: When adding family members, should the system support voice introduction like "This is my wife Sarah" during live camera view?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (natural interaction - point camera at person and introduce them verbally)

## Q8: Should recognized family members' names be stored in the existing jarvis_learning.db for persistence across restarts?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (leverages existing SQLite infrastructure, ensures data persists)

## Q9: Should the vision response prioritize identifying known people over generic object detection?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (people recognition is more important than "61% confidence detecting 2 people")

## Q10: Should family member data include relationship type (wife, son, daughter, etc.) for more natural responses?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (enables responses like "I see your wife Sarah" instead of just "I see Sarah")
