# Initial Request: Unified Vision Improvements

## User Request
Improve the unified vision system that was just implemented, addressing issues with:
- Introduction patterns not being recognized ("its me George i created you")
- Wrong tool selection (routing to Tavily instead of vision)
- Face recognition integration
- Natural language responses

## Context
The user has been testing the newly integrated unified vision system and encountered several issues:
1. When saying "do you see me", it responds but doesn't recognize the user
2. When saying "its me George i created you", it incorrectly routes to Tavily and gets a 401 error
3. The system should support self-introductions and family member introductions
4. Need better integration between vision tool and face recognition tool

## Current State
- Unified vision system has been integrated into jarvis_pure_adaptive_claude_launcher.py
- Database tables (family_members, face_recognition_history) exist in jarvis_learning.db
- Basic introduction patterns work for family members
- Self-introduction patterns were just added but need further improvements

## Goals
- Ensure all introduction patterns are properly recognized
- Fix tool routing to always use vision for introductions
- Improve face recognition integration
- Enhance natural language responses
- Make the system more robust and user-friendly
