# Discovery Questions - Unified Vision Improvements

## Q1: Will the system need to handle multiple simultaneous users introducing themselves?
**Default if unknown:** No (typically one person speaks to Jarvis at a time)

## Q2: Should the system remember faces across different camera sources (webcam, UniFi Protect, etc.)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (consistent recognition regardless of camera source)

## Q3: Will users need to modify or remove previously introduced family members?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (family dynamics change over time)

## Q4: Should the system provide voice announcements when recognizing known people?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (natural interaction includes acknowledging presence)

## Q5: Do you want the system to learn faces automatically without explicit introduction?
**Default if unknown:** No (privacy and control - only learn when explicitly told)
